## A Comprehensive Federal Tax Reform Proposal

-----

## Executive Summary

The American Prosperity Act replaces the byzantine 75,000-page federal tax code with a simplified structure that:

- **Taxes economic activity and velocity** rather than wealth accumulation or productive labor
- **Crushes financial speculation** while protecting long-term investment and retirement security
- **Unleashes small business growth** through the most aggressive employment incentives in American history
- **Eliminates tax avoidance schemes** used by the ultra-wealthy while simplifying compliance for everyone
- **Maintains federal revenue** at ~$4.5-5.3 trillion annually while dramatically reducing complexity

**Core Philosophy:** Government’s role is to maintain infrastructure for economic activity—therefore, tax the flow of money through the economy, not the stock of accumulated wealth or the fruits of productive labor.

-----

## The Failure of the Current System

### Complexity as a Tool of Inequity

The current federal tax code spans **75,000 pages** of regulations, exemptions, carve-outs, and special interest provisions. This complexity isn’t accidental—it’s a feature that benefits those who can afford sophisticated tax planning:

- **Effective tax rates by sophistication:**
  - Working-class American: 24.2% effective federal rate
  - Small business owner: 19.7% effective rate
  - Multinational corporation: 9.2% effective rate
  - Ultra-wealthy individual: 8.2% effective rate (via capital gains preference, carried interest, step-up basis)

**The tax code has become a regressive system where complexity equals tax avoidance.**

### The Financialization Crisis

America’s economy has fundamentally shifted from productive enterprise to paper speculation:

**1970s Economic Composition:**

- Financial sector profits: 10% of total corporate profits
- Manufacturing: 25% of total corporate profits
- Financial sector employment: 4% of workforce

**2020s Economic Composition:**

- Financial sector profits: **25% of total corporate profits**
- Manufacturing: 11% of total corporate profits
- Financial sector employment: 7% of workforce (but capturing 25% of profit)

**Translation:** We’ve built an economy where moving money around is 2.5x more profitable than making things.

**Daily U.S. stock trading volume:** $500-600 billion  
**Daily U.S. GDP production:** $71 billion

**We trade 7-8 times more value than we produce each day.** This isn’t capitalism—it’s financialized speculation that extracts wealth rather than creating it.

### The “Buy, Borrow, Die” Loophole

The ultra-wealthy have perfected a tax avoidance strategy that makes income taxes irrelevant:

**Step 1 - Buy:** Acquire appreciating assets (stocks, real estate)  
**Step 2 - Borrow:** Take loans secured by assets (tax-free, no realization event)  
**Step 3 - Die:** Assets pass to heirs with stepped-up basis (gains forgiven)

**Real example:**

- Billionaire owns $10B in stock (cost basis: $100M)
- Borrows $500M at 3% interest using stock as collateral
- Lives on borrowed money (tax-free)
- Pays $15M annual interest (deductible)
- Dies with $9.5B in unrealized gains that heirs receive tax-free
- **Total income tax paid on $500M in living expenses: $0**

**Annual securities-based lending market:** $500-700 billion and growing rapidly

The tax code rewards those who can live without “income” while working Americans pay taxes on every dollar earned.

### The Small Business Penalty

Current corporate tax structure actively punishes small businesses and rewards scale:

**Effective corporate tax rates by size:**

- Fortune 500 company: 9-12% (after deductions, credits, offshore strategies)
- 100-person company: 18-21% (limited optimization options)
- 10-person company: 21-24% (pays full statutory rate)

**Plus regulatory compliance costs:**

- Fortune 500: $0.01 per dollar of revenue (economy of scale)
- Small business: $0.12 per dollar of revenue

**Result:** The tax code is written by and for megacorporations. Small businesses pay the highest rates and highest compliance costs.

## The American Prosperity Act Structure

### Core Tax Rates

**Personal Income Tax:**

- **15%** on income up to $1,000,000
- **25%** on income above $1,000,000
- Capital gains taxed as ordinary income (no preferential rate)

**Corporate Income Tax:**

- **20%** flat rate on taxable income
- Aggressive per-employee deductions (see below)

**Financial Transaction Taxes:**

- **2.5%** Securities transactions (stocks, bonds)
- **5.0%** Derivatives and options transactions
- **1.5%** Personal loan originations
- **3.0%** Corporate loan originations
- **5.0%** Stock-secured loan originations

**General Sales Tax:**

- **5.0%** on final consumption (with essential exemptions)

**Retirement Account Tax:**

- **5.0%** on distributions from retirement accounts (replaces income taxation on withdrawals)

-----

## Personal Deductions - Simplified and Universal

**No itemization. No phase-outs. No complexity.**

Every American receives these standard deductions against income:

### Child Deduction

- **$5,000 per child** (maximum 3 children)
- **Total maximum: $15,000**

### Healthcare Deduction

- **$10,000** for healthcare expenses
- Aligns with National Healthcare Security Account (NHSA) contributions

### Opportunity Deduction

- **$15,000** for individuals earning ≤80% of median wage (~$42,000)
- Phases out completely at median wage (~$52,000)
- Protects lowest-income workers from regressive sales tax effects

### Retirement Contribution Deduction

- **$25,000** for contributions to qualified retirement accounts
- Encourages personal savings and financial security

### Education Savings Deduction

- **$10,000** for contributions to education savings accounts
- Usable for taxpayer or dependent’s qualified education expenses
- Anti-fraud: Requires account registration and qualified institution verification

**Maximum possible personal deductions: $75,000**

**Example household (family of 3, $80,000 income):**

- Income: $80,000
- Deductions: $15,000 (children) + $10,000 (healthcare) + $25,000 (retirement) + $10,000 (education) = $60,000
- Taxable income: $20,000
- Tax owed: $20,000 × 15% = **$3,000**
- Effective rate: **3.75%**

**Example high earner ($500,000 income, single):**

- Income: $500,000
- Deductions: $25,000 (retirement) + $10,000 (healthcare) = $35,000
- Taxable income: $465,000
- Tax owed: ($465,000 × 15%) = **$69,750**
- Effective rate: **13.95%**

-----

## Corporate Deductions - The Small Business Revolution

**Per-employee deductions based on company size:**

### Wage Deductions (Per U.S. Citizen Employee)

- **$7,500** per employee for companies with <50 employees
- **$5,000** per employee for companies with 50-500 employees
- **$2,500** per employee for companies with >500 employees

### Employee Retirement Match Deduction

- **$7,500** per employee for employer retirement contributions
- Available to all company sizes

### Employee Healthcare Deduction

- **$7,500** per employee for employer healthcare contributions
- Aligns perfectly with NHSA employer HSA contribution cap
- Available to all company sizes

**Anti-Gaming Provision - Consolidated Ownership Rule:**

- Deductions based on total employees under common ownership (>50% control)
- Prevents large companies from splitting into “small” entities
- Blocks Amazon from creating 10,000 subsidiaries to claim $7,500/employee rate

### Revolutionary Impact Examples

**20-person small business:**

- Revenue: $5,000,000
- Gross profit: $500,000
- Employee deductions:
  - Wages: 20 × $7,500 = $150,000
  - Retirement: 20 × $7,500 = $150,000
  - Healthcare: 20 × $7,500 = $150,000
  - **Total deductions: $450,000**
- Taxable income: $500,000 - $450,000 = $50,000
- Tax owed: $50,000 × 20% = **$10,000**
- **Effective tax rate: 2.0%**

**1,000-person corporation:**

- Revenue: $5,000,000,000
- Gross profit: $500,000,000
- Employee deductions:
  - Wages: 1,000 × $2,500 = $2,500,000
  - Retirement: 1,000 × $7,500 = $7,500,000
  - Healthcare: 1,000 × $7,500 = $7,500,000
  - **Total deductions: $17,500,000**
- Taxable income: $482,500,000
- Tax owed: $482,500,000 × 20% = **$96,500,000**
- **Effective tax rate: 19.3%**

**The incentive is clear: Small businesses can achieve near-zero tax rates by maximizing employment. Large corporations pay close to the statutory rate.**

## Financial Transaction Taxes - Killing Speculation, Protecting Investment

### The Philosophical Foundation

**Question:** Why should the federal government tax financial transactions?

**Answer:** Because government maintains the infrastructure that makes those transactions possible:

- SEC enforcement and market regulation
- Federal court system for contract disputes
- FDIC insurance and financial stability
- Payment systems and clearing houses
- Property rights and rule of law

**High-velocity financial activity creates high demand for governmental infrastructure—therefore it should bear proportional tax burden.**

### Securities Transaction Tax (2.5%)

**Applied to:** Stock purchases, bond purchases, ETF trades  
**Not applied to:** Transactions within qualified retirement accounts

**Impact on investor types:**

**Long-term investor (buys $100k stock, holds 10 years, sells):**

- Purchase tax: $2,500
- Holding period: $0
- Sale tax: $2,500
- Total tax on $100k invested over 10 years: **$5,000 (0.5% annually)**

**Day trader (trades $100k position 50 times per year):**

- Annual transaction tax: $100,000 × 50 trades × 2.5% = **$125,000**
- Tax exceeds entire trading capital in one year
- **Day trading becomes mathematically impossible**

**High-frequency trader (microsecond arbitrage):**

- Transaction costs now 2.5% per trade
- Microsecond price differentials typically 0.01-0.05%
- **High-frequency trading becomes instantly unprofitable and disappears**

**Expected behavioral change:**

- Trading volume decreases 40-50%
- Bid-ask spreads widen slightly (0.1-0.2%)
- Market volatility decreases (fewer momentum trades)
- Long-term capital formation unaffected

**Revenue projection:** $1.875-2.25 trillion annually

### Derivatives Tax (5.0%)

**Applied to:** Options, futures, swaps, credit default swaps, synthetic instruments

**Rationale:** Derivatives serve two purposes:

1. Legitimate hedging (small percentage of market)
2. Pure speculation (vast majority of market)

A 5% tax makes speculation prohibitively expensive while allowing genuine hedging to continue at reasonable cost.

**Impact:**

- Speculative derivatives trading collapses 60-70%
- Hedging continues (5% is acceptable cost for risk management)
- Reduces systemic risk from overleveraged derivative positions

**Revenue projection:** $300-400 billion annually

### Loan Origination Taxes

**Personal Loans (1.5%):**

- Mortgages, auto loans, student loans, personal loans
- One-time tax on loan origination amount
- $300,000 mortgage = $4,500 tax (typically rolled into closing costs)

**Corporate Loans (3.0%):**

- Business loans, commercial real estate, corporate bonds
- Discourages excessive corporate leverage
- Incentivizes equity financing over debt loading

**Stock-Secured Loans (5.0%) - The “Buy, Borrow, Die” Killer:**

- Applied to any loan collateralized by securities
- Makes tax-free lifestyle borrowing expensive
- $10M loan against stock portfolio = $500,000 tax
- **Eliminates primary ultra-wealthy tax avoidance strategy**

**Combined loan tax revenue projection:** $148 billion annually

-----

## General Sales Tax (5.0%) - With Strategic Exclusions

### Essential Exclusions (Protect Low-Income Americans)

**Tax-free items:**

- Unprepared groceries (not restaurant meals)
- Prescription medications
- Primary residence rent payments (not purchase)
- Medical services and procedures
- Childcare services
- K-12 education tuition and fees

### Economic Growth Exclusions

**Tax-free items:**

- Manufacturing equipment (business purchases)
- Agricultural supplies and equipment
- Exported goods and services
- Business-to-business services (avoiding tax pyramiding)

### What IS Taxed (5%)

- Restaurant meals and prepared foods
- Retail goods (clothing, electronics, furniture, etc.)
- Entertainment and recreation
- Personal services (haircuts, etc.)
- Luxury goods
- Vehicle purchases
- Real estate purchases

**Revenue projection:** $400-500 billion annually

-----

## Retirement Account Structure - Complete Tax Protection

### The Retirement Security Compact

To encourage personal savings and financial independence, retirement accounts receive unprecedented tax advantages:

**Tax treatment:**

- **Contributions:** $25,000 annual tax deduction
- **Growth:** No capital gains tax on appreciation
- **Transactions:** Fully exempt from 2.5% securities transaction tax
- **Employer match:** $7,500 employer contribution deduction
- **Withdrawals:** 5% retirement tax (instead of income tax rates)

**Example 30-year accumulation:**

- Annual contribution: $25,000 (tax deductible)
- Employer match: $7,500
- Total annual savings: $32,500
- Investment period: 30 years
- Average return: 7% annually
- **Final value: ~$3.1 million**

**Tax paid:**

- During accumulation: $0 (deductible contributions)
- On transactions within account: $0 (exempt from 2.5% tax)
- On withdrawal: 5% retirement tax = $155,000 total
- **Effective lifetime tax rate on retirement savings: 5%**

**Compare to current system:**

- Contribution phase: Taxed as income (~15-25%)
- Growth phase: Deferred
- Withdrawal phase: Taxed as income (~15-25%)
- **Current effective rate: 15-25%**

**The APA creates the most generous retirement savings regime in American history.**

## The Anti-Financialization Revolution

### Why America Lost Its Way

In 1970, America was the world’s manufacturing powerhouse. Financial services existed to support productive enterprise—banks lent to businesses, markets funded growth, insurance spread risk.

By 2020, this relationship inverted. The financial sector became the economy, with productive enterprise serving merely as fodder for trading, speculation, and fee extraction.

**The evidence:**

**Corporate behavior transformation:**

- 1970s: Average S&P 500 company held stock for 5 years
- 2020s: Average holding period is 10 months
- 1970s: 2% of corporate profits spent on stock buybacks
- 2020s: 50% of corporate profits spent on stock buybacks

**Economic productivity:**

- 1970-2000: Productivity growth 2.5% annually
- 2000-2020: Productivity growth 1.4% annually (financialization era)

**Innovation metrics:**

- 1970s: 80% of R&D funding from corporate profits reinvested
- 2020s: 40% of R&D funding from corporate profits (rest returned to shareholders)

**The financialization tax:**

- Total financial sector revenue: ~$1.5 trillion annually
- Value created for real economy: Debatable
- This is extraction, not creation

### How APA Reverses Financialization

**The 2.5% securities transaction tax makes:**

- ❌ Day trading unprofitable
- ❌ High-frequency trading impossible
- ❌ Momentum trading expensive
- ❌ Speculative churning costly
- ✅ Long-term investment attractive
- ✅ Buy-and-hold strategies optimal
- ✅ Patient capital rewarded

**The 5% derivatives tax makes:**

- ❌ Speculative bets prohibitive
- ❌ Synthetic leverage expensive
- ❌ Financial engineering unprofitable
- ✅ Genuine hedging acceptable
- ✅ Real risk management continues
- ✅ Systemic leverage reduced

**The 5% stock-secured loan tax makes:**

- ❌ Tax-free living on borrowed wealth impossible
- ❌ “Buy, borrow, die” strategy crushed
- ❌ Wealth extraction without realization blocked
- ✅ Actual income realization required
- ✅ Tax base broadened to ultra-wealthy

**Expected economic rebalancing:**

**Year 1-3 effects:**

- Financial sector employment: -15 to -25%
- But: Those workers redeploy to productive sectors
- Wall Street trading desks shrink
- But: Main Street small businesses boom

**Year 5-10 effects:**

- Financial sector profits: -30 to -40% (return to supporting role)
- Manufacturing investment: +25 to +40% (capital freed from speculation)
- Small business formation: +50 to +100% (employment incentives + freed capital)
- Wage growth: +3 to +5% annually (employer healthcare savings + competition for workers)

**This is the intentional rebalancing of the American economy away from paper speculation and back toward productive enterprise.**

-----

## The Small Business Republic

### The Death of American Entrepreneurship

The American economy was built by small businesses—entrepreneurs taking risks, creating jobs, building communities. That engine has stalled:

**Small business formation rates:**

- 1980s: 15 new businesses per 1,000 working-age adults
- 2020s: 8 new businesses per 1,000 working-age adults
- **Small business formation has collapsed 47%**

**Why?**

1. **Healthcare costs:** Can’t compete with large employer plans
2. **Tax complexity:** Can’t afford sophisticated planning
3. **Regulatory burden:** Compliance costs are fixed, crushing small scale
4. **Competitive disadvantage:** Large corporations have lower effective tax rates
5. **Capital access:** Banks prefer lending to established corporations

**The result:** Economic concentration and wealth concentration are the same phenomenon

**Share of total business revenue by firm size:**

- 1980: Fortune 500 = 40%, Small business = 35%, Mid-size = 25%
- 2020: Fortune 500 = 58%, Small business = 22%, Mid-size = 20%

**Share of total employment:**

- 1980: Fortune 500 = 35%, Small business = 45%, Mid-size = 20%
- 2020: Fortune 500 = 47%, Small business = 33%, Mid-size = 20%

**America is becoming a nation of employees, not entrepreneurs.**

### How APA Creates the Small Business Explosion

The combination of aggressive small business tax incentives and freed healthcare capital creates the most pro-entrepreneurship environment in a century:

**Per-employee deduction impact:**

**A 10-person company paying $60k average salary:**

- Gross profit needed: $600,000 (for wages)
- Tax deductions available:
  - Wages: 10 × $7,500 = $75,000
  - Retirement: 10 × $7,500 = $75,000
  - Healthcare: 10 × $7,500 = $75,000
  - **Total: $225,000**

**If the company generates $750,000 gross profit:**

- Profit: $750,000
- Wages paid: $600,000
- Profit after wages: $150,000
- Tax deductions: $225,000
- **Taxable income: -$75,000 (loss carryforward)**
- Tax owed: **$0**

**This company has NEGATIVE tax burden. The government is subsidizing job creation.**

**Scale comparison:**

**10-person company:** Effective rate 0% (with deductions)  
**100-person company:** Effective rate ~8-12% (with deductions)  
**1,000-person company:** Effective rate ~18-19% (with deductions)

**For the first time in American history, the tax code explicitly favors small businesses over large corporations.**

### The Entrepreneurship Multiplier

**Current barrier to starting a business:**

- Must leave job (lose health insurance)
- Must pay individual market premiums (2-3x employer rates)
- Must pay full payroll taxes immediately
- Must navigate complex tax compliance
- Face higher effective tax rates than established competitors

**Under APA + NHSA:**

- ✅ Keep catastrophic health protection regardless of employment
- ✅ Simple, clear tax rates with generous deductions
- ✅ Lower effective tax rate than large competitors
- ✅ Can offer competitive wages (not burdened by healthcare premiums)
- ✅ Every employee hired reduces tax burden

**Expected impact on entrepreneurship:**

**Conservative scenario:**

- New business formation increases 50%
- From 8 per 1,000 to 12 per 1,000 working-age adults
- ~1.6 million new businesses annually (vs. current ~800,000)
- Average 4 employees per new business
- **6.4 million new jobs over 5 years from new venture creation**

**Optimistic scenario:**

- New business formation doubles (returns to 1980s levels)
- 16 per 1,000 working-age adults
- ~3.2 million new businesses annually
- **12.8 million new jobs over 5 years**

**This represents the rebirth of the American entrepreneurial spirit—enabled by smart tax policy.**

## Protective Framework - The Ratchet System

### The Wall Street Lobbying Threat

Financial services spent **$2.9 billion on lobbying** in 2020-2024. They will immediately target the APA’s transaction taxes for elimination or reduction. Without structural protections, a future pro-Wall Street administration could gut the system through regulatory changes.

**The solution: Build automatic protections that make rate reductions nearly impossible and rate increases automatic when needed.**

### Layer 1: Statutory Rate Floors (Unchangeable Without Supermajority)

**Minimum rates locked in statute:**

- Securities transaction tax: **2.5% minimum**
- Derivatives transaction tax: **5.0% minimum**
- Stock-secured loan tax: **5.0% minimum**
- Corporate loan origination tax: **3.0% minimum**
- Personal loan origination tax: **1.5% minimum**

**Any reduction below these floors requires:**

- 2/3 vote in both House and Senate, OR
- Constitutional amendment

**No regulatory agency, executive order, or administrative action can reduce rates below statutory minimums.**

### Layer 2: Revenue Floor Requirement (Automatic Rate Increases)

**Mandatory revenue target:**

- Financial transaction taxes must generate minimum **$2.0 trillion annually**
- Adjusted for inflation using chained CPI
- If revenue falls below 95% of target for 2 consecutive fiscal years:
  - **All financial transaction tax rates automatically increase 15%**
  - No Congressional action required
  - Prevents “starve the beast” strategies

**Example:**

- Target: $2.0T, Actual: $1.85T for FY 2026 and FY 2027
- Automatic trigger: All rates increase 15% on January 1, 2028
- Securities tax: 2.5% → 2.875%
- Derivatives tax: 5.0% → 5.75%
- Stock-secured loans: 5.0% → 5.75%

### Layer 3: Automatic Increase Triggers (One-Way Ratchets)

**High-Frequency Trading Trigger:**

- If HFT exceeds 40% of total market volume for 6 consecutive months:
- Securities transaction tax automatically increases to **3.5%**
- Prevents algorithmic speculation from dominating markets

**Derivatives Speculation Trigger:**

- If derivatives market notional value exceeds 25x GDP for 12 consecutive months:
- Derivatives tax automatically increases to **7.5%**
- Prevents systemic leverage buildup

**Wealth Inequality Trigger:**

- If Gini coefficient exceeds 0.50 for 2 consecutive years:
- Stock-secured loan tax automatically increases to **7.5%**
- Prevents ultra-wealthy from using debt to avoid all taxation

**Critical feature: These are ONE-WAY RATCHETS**

- Rates increase automatically when triggers are met
- Rates can only decrease through full Congressional legislation
- No regulatory discretion to slowly erode protections

### Layer 4: Independent Review Commission (Limited Power to Reduce)

**Five-Year Comprehensive Review:**

- Independent Federal Transaction Tax Review Board
- 5 members: 2 Presidential appointees, 2 Congressional appointees (1 per party), 1 Federal Reserve appointee
- 10-year staggered terms to prevent partisan capture

**Commission powers:**

- Annual review of market health, liquidity, economic impacts
- Authority to recommend rate adjustments within statutory bands
- **Can recommend increases by simple majority (3/5 vote)**
- **Can recommend reductions ONLY with 4/5 supermajority AND meeting narrow criteria:**

**Criteria for rate reduction recommendation:**

- Market liquidity has fallen below critical threshold (bid-ask spreads exceeding 3x historical average for 12+ consecutive months), AND
- Independent economic analysis shows reduction would restore liquidity without reducing revenue below floor, AND
- No alternative policy solutions exist

**Congressional override:**

- Any commission recommendation requires 180-day Congressional review period
- Congress can override with simple majority vote
- If Congress takes no action, recommendation takes effect after 180 days

**This structure makes it easy to raise rates, nearly impossible to lower them.**

### Layer 5: Emergency Override (Narrow and Temporary)

**Systemic crisis provision:**

- President + Federal Reserve Chair + Treasury Secretary can jointly declare financial emergency
- Can temporarily reduce transaction tax rates for maximum 90 days
- **Only if:** “Systemic financial crisis threatens market function and economic stability”

**Mandatory Congressional review:**

- Emergency declaration must be submitted to Congress within 24 hours
- Congress has 30 days to affirm or reject
- If rejected or no action: Rates snap back immediately
- If affirmed: Can extend 90 days, requires new affirmation for each extension

**Transparency requirement:**

- All emergency declarations published immediately
- Full economic analysis published within 48 hours
- No secret backroom deals

**This allows legitimate crisis response while preventing abuse.**

### Why This Framework Works

✅ **Wall Street cannot lobby their way out** - Statutory floors require 2/3 Congressional vote

✅ **Self-correcting upward** - Multiple automatic triggers raise rates when needed

✅ **Prevents death by a thousand cuts** - No regulatory discretion for “technical adjustments”

✅ **Transparent and rules-based** - All changes are automatic or require public votes

✅ **Legitimate crisis response exists** - Narrow emergency provision for genuine systemic threats

✅ **Bipartisan commission has limited reduction power** - Requires supermajority and strict criteria

**When opponents argue “this locks in bad policy forever,” the response is simple:**

*“We’ve had a progressive income tax since 1913—112 years of tinkering, loopholes, and special interest carve-outs created the 75,000-page tax code we’re replacing. The APA has simple rates and strong guardrails precisely because we’ve learned that Wall Street will always find ways to rig the system in their favor. These protections ensure financial speculation stays expensive, productive work stays lightly taxed, and the rules don’t change every time a new administration wants to reward donors. The rates can go UP if speculation gets out of hand. They can only go DOWN if markets are genuinely broken. That’s not inflexibility—that’s wisdom.”*

## American Prosperity Act - Messaging Guide by Audience

### For Conservatives: “Preserving Freedom ”

#### The Pitch

**“The most pro-business, anti-Washington tax reform in American history. We’re replacing 75,000 pages of government complexity with rates you can write on a napkin—and crushing Wall Street speculation while we’re at it.”**

#### The Enemy (That Conservatives Can Rally Against)

**Wall Street Cronyism:**

- APA: Speculation taxed at 2.5-5%, productive work at 15%
- Crushes high-frequency trading (extractive, not productive)
- Eliminates “buy, borrow, die” tax avoidance for ultra-wealthy

**Regulatory Complexity:**

- 75,000 pages of tax code = government overreach
- Created by lobbyists, enforced by bureaucrats
- APA: Simple rates, clear rules, minimal compliance
- Cut IRS from 80,000+ needed employees to 15,000

**Crony Capitalism:**

- Current code riddled with special interest carve-outs
- Electric vehicle credits, green energy subsidies, carried interest loopholes
- APA: No special favors, no lobbyist-written exemptions
- Pure market competition on level playing field

#### The Aspiration

**“Imagine America where:**

- Starting a business is simple (no tax lawyer needed)
- Hiring workers reduces your taxes (not increases them)
- Small businesses compete on equal footing with megacorps
- The tax code rewards work, not speculation
- States compete to attract residents and businesses

-----

### For Progressives: “Promoting Fairness”

#### The Pitch

**“For the first time in history, the ultra-wealthy actually pay their fair share—not through tax rates they avoid anyway, but through taxes they can’t escape. Wall Street’s extraction economy ends. Small business workers win.”**

#### Core Values Alignment

**Economic Justice:**

- Ultra-wealthy currently pay 8% effective rate (via tax avoidance schemes)
- APA forces them to pay 18-25% (through unavoidable transaction taxes)
- “Buy, borrow, die” strategy crushed (5% tax on stock-secured loans)
- No more billionaires living tax-free on borrowed wealth

**Worker Empowerment:**

- Working class effective tax rate: 4-6% (vs. current 12-15%)
- Opportunity deduction: $15k for those earning ≤80% median wage
- Employer healthcare savings → $3-5k annual wage increases
- Small business employment boom = bargaining power for workers

**Wall Street Accountability:**

- 2.5% tax on stock trades (kills parasitic speculation)
- 5% tax on derivatives (eliminates financial gambling)
- High-frequency trading becomes impossible (good riddance)
- Financial sector shrinks 30-40% = capital flows to real economy

**Reducing Inequality:**

- Wealth Gini coefficient: 0.49 → 0.42 (significant reduction)
- Bottom 50% tax burden decreases
- Top 1% tax burden increases dramatically
- Achieved without confiscatory rates (smart design vs. brute force)

#### The Enemy (That Progressives Can Rally Against)

**The Extractive Economy:**

- Wall Street profits: 25% of all corporate profits, but only 7% of GDP
- Daily trading volume: $500B. Daily GDP: $71B. We trade 7x more than we produce
- Speculation extracts wealth, doesn’t create it
- APA ends the extraction

**Tax Avoidance by the Rich:**

- Billionaire strategy: Hold stocks, borrow against them, pay zero taxes
- $500-700 billion in securities-based loans annually (all tax-free)
- Die, heirs get stepped-up basis, gains forgiven forever
- APA: 5% tax on those loans = avoidance scheme destroyed

**Corporate Consolidation:**

- Amazon, Walmart, monopolies pay lower effective tax rates than small competitors
- They can afford armies of tax lawyers and lobbyists
- Result: Market domination, worker exploitation, community destruction
- APA: Small businesses pay 0-5%, megacorps pay 17-19% (fair competition)

#### The Aspiration

**“Imagine America where:**

- A billionaire can’t live tax-free while teachers pay 15%
- Wall Street serves the economy instead of extracting from it
- Small businesses create millions of good-paying jobs
- Workers have power because employers compete for them
- Wealth inequality actually decreases
- Economic security is universal (via NHSA + APA)”

#### Key Statistics for Progressive Audiences

- **Wealth inequality (Gini):** 0.49 → 0.42 (significant improvement)
- **Wage growth:** 2.5% → 6-9% annually (workers finally win)
- **Small business jobs:** +15-25 million over 5 years (distributed economic power)

#### The Soundbite

*“Wall Street finally pays. The ultra-wealthy can’t avoid it anymore. Working families get relief. Small business workers get raises. Speculation dies, real economy thrives. This is economic justice through smart design.”*

-----

### For Libertarians: “Securing Liberty”

#### The Pitch

**“We’re eliminating 75,000 pages of government control over your economic life and replacing it with simple math. Want to start a business? No permission needed, no tax penalty. Want to save for retirement? Keep almost all of it. Want to avoid taxes? Stop speculating and start producing.”**

#### Core Values Alignment

**Individual Liberty:**

- Your economic choices are yours (not Washington’s to micromanage)
- No tax code steering you toward “approved” behaviors
- Simple, transparent rates you can verify yourself
- Government can’t social engineer through complexity

**Negative Rights (Government Restraint):**

- Only lawyers and accountants can navigate it (rent-seeking intermediaries)
- Compliance costs: $500 billion annually (pure waste)
- APA: Simple rates, no interpretation needed, minimal compliance

**Crony Capitalism:**

- Current system: Those with lobbyists pay less
- Tax breaks for politically connected industries
- Government picking winners and losers
- APA: No special favors, no industry carve-outs, pure competition

**Federal Overreach:**

- Income tax funds $6T+ government heading toward $8T
- Far beyond constitutional enumerated powers
- APA funds $4.5T government doing core functions only
- Forces federal restraint through revenue limitation

**Speculation vs. Production Inversion:**

- Current system rewards financial engineering over building

#### The Aspiration

**“Imagine America where:**

- Government is simple, transparent, limited

#### The Soundbite

*“Seventy-five thousand pages of government control, gone. Replace it with math you can do yourself. Start a business, no penalty. Speculate, pay heavily. Produce, pay lightly. Government limited, liberty expansive. This is economic freedom.”*

### For Average Americans: “ Restoring Common Sense ”

#### The Pitch

**“Your taxes finally make sense. No accountant needed. No weird loopholes. You work, you pay 15%. You hire someone, your taxes go DOWN. You save for retirement, you keep almost all of it. Simple. Fair. Done.”**

#### What This Means For Your Life

**Your Tax Return (Literally 5 Minutes):**

2. Subtract your deductions:
- Kids: $5,000 each (up to 3)
- Healthcare: $10,000
- Retirement: $25,000

1. Multiply by 15%

**If you day-trade stocks, you’ll pay a lot more:**

- 2.5% tax every time you trade
- Long-term investors barely affected
- But if you trade constantly, it adds up
- **This is intentional** (stops speculation, protects your 401k from Wall Street games)

**If you’re ultra-wealthy, you’ll actually pay taxes:**

- Can’t borrow against stocks tax-free anymore
- Can’t avoid income taxes through financial tricks
- You’ll pay like everyone else
- **Finally fair**

#### What Stays The Same

✅ You still choose your doctor (NHSA)

✅ You still choose where to live  
✅ You still start businesses freely  
✅ Government doesn’t control more of your life

#### The Common Sense Test

**Ask yourself:**

- Should filing taxes require a professional? **NO → APA fixes this**
- Should billionaires pay lower rates than teachers? **NO → APA fixes this**
- Should Wall Street speculation be tax-free? **NO → APA fixes this**
- Should starting a business mean losing healthcare? **NO → NHSA+APA fix this**
- Should taxes be simple enough to understand? **YES → APA delivers this**

#### The Soundbite

### For Small Business Owners: “Building America with American Grit ”

#### The Pitch

**“For the first time in American history, the tax code is designed for YOU, not against you. Every employee you hire REDUCES your taxes. You can finally compete with Amazon and Walmart. Your effective tax rate? Close to zero if you’re creating jobs.”**

#### The Revolution: Hiring Reduces Your Taxes

**Current system (punishment for job creation):**

- Hire employee at $60k salary
- Add $17k health insurance
- Add payroll taxes
- Total cost: $83k+
- Tax benefit: Maybe $12k deduction
- **Net: Hiring is expensive**

**APA system (reward for job creation):**

- Hire employee at $60k salary
- Tax deductions available:
  - Wage deduction: $7,500 (if <50 employees)
  - Retirement match: $7,500
  - Healthcare contribution: $7,500
  - **Total deductions: $22,500 per employee**
- Corporate tax rate: 20%
- **Tax savings: $4,500 per employee hired**

**If you have 20 employees and make $500k profit:**

- Deductions: 20 × $22,500 = $450,000
- Taxable income: $50,000
- Tax owed: $10,000
- **Effective rate: 2%**

#### Size-Based Competitive Advantage

**The system now favors YOU over megacorps:**

**Your 20-person company:**

- Per-employee deductions: $22,500
- Effective tax rate: 0-5%
- Can offer competitive wages (no healthcare premium burden)
- **Finally compete on equal footing**

**Amazon (>500 employees):**

- Per-employee deductions: $12,500 (much less)
- Effective tax rate: 17-19%
- Loses tax advantage from complexity
- **You win on tax efficiency**

#### Real Business Examples

**Example 1: Local Restaurant (12 employees)**

- Revenue: $2,000,000
- Profit: $200,000
- Employee deductions: 12 × $22,500 = $270,000
- Taxable income: -$70,000 (loss carryforward)
- Tax owed: **$0**
- **You pay NOTHING in corporate tax while growing**

**Example 2: Manufacturing Startup (35 employees)**

- Revenue: $10,000,000
- Profit: $800,000
- Employee deductions: 35 × $22,500 = $787,500
- Taxable income: $12,500
- Tax owed: $2,500
- **Effective rate: 0.3%**

**Example 3: Tech Company (150 employees)**

- Revenue: $50,000,000
- Profit: $5,000,000
- Employee deductions: 150 × $17,500 = $2,625,000
- Taxable income: $2,375,000
- Tax owed: $475,000
- **Effective rate: 9.5% (vs. 21% current)**

#### What This Means For Growth

**Hiring Decision (Current System):**

- “Can I afford another $80k+ in total comp?”
- “Will revenue support it?”
- “Can I offer competitive benefits?”
- **Result: Hesitate, stay small**

**Hiring Decision (APA System):**

- “This person will REDUCE my taxes by $4,500”
- “Plus bring in revenue”
- “Healthcare through NHSA, I just contribute $7,500”
- **Result: Hire aggressively, grow fast**

#### Freedom From Healthcare Burden

**Current system:**

- Small group health insurance: $20-25k per family
- Can’t negotiate like large employers
- Employees expect it, you can’t afford it
- **Lose talent to big corporations**

**APA + NHSA system:**

- Employees have catastrophic coverage (NHSA)
- You can contribute $7,500 to their HSA (tax deductible for you)
- No premium negotiations, no broker fees
- **Compete for talent on wages and culture, not benefits complexity**

#### The Competitive Transformation

**What becomes possible:**

✅ **Wage competition:** Your healthcare savings → higher wages than corporate jobs

✅ **Rapid hiring:** Every employee hired reduces tax burden (negative marginal cost)

✅ **Geographic freedom:** Not locked to states with insurance markets

✅ **Simplified operations:** No benefits manager, no broker, no compliance nightmare

✅ **Recession resilience:** Lower fixed costs, easier to weather downturns

✅ **Exit strategy:** More valuable business (lower tax burden = higher multiples)

#### The Innovation Unlock

**Capital freed for growth:**

- No longer spending $17k/employee on insurance
- Reduced to $7,500 HSA contribution
- **$9,500 per employee freed annually**

**For a 30-person company:**

- Healthcare savings: 30 × $9,500 = $285,000/year
- Use for: R&D, marketing, expansion, wage increases, profit
- **This is YOUR capital, not insurance companies’**

#### The Soundbite

*“Every employee you hire reduces your taxes by $4,500. Your effective rate: close to zero if you’re creating jobs. Amazon pays 17%, you pay 2%. Finally, the little guy wins. Hire, grow, compete, thrive.”*

## Cross-Cutting Themes (Use With All Audiences)

### The Simplicity Message

**“Your grandmother could do her taxes. Your teenager could do theirs. No forms, no receipts, no accountant, no stress. Just simple math. This is what government should be: clear, fair, understandable.”**

### The Fairness Message

**“For 100 years, we’ve watched the ultra-wealthy avoid taxes legally while working Americans pay every penny. That ends. Not through confiscation, through smart design. They can’t avoid transaction taxes. They finally pay. Fair at last.”**

### The Growth Message

**“We’re freeing $600 billion trapped in healthcare premiums, crushing $500 billion in tax compliance waste, and redirecting speculation to production. That’s over $1 trillion in freed capital. Jobs, wages, innovation, growth. This is economic acceleration.”**

### The Freedom Message

**“No more job lock from healthcare. No more tax code complexity controlling your choices. No more government picking winners. Start a business, hire people, invest long-term, build wealth. You’re free. Finally.”**

### The Security Message

**“Catastrophic healthcare protection (NHSA). Retirement security (protected savings). Simplified taxes (no surprise bills). Economic boom (jobs everywhere). This isn’t insecurity—this is the foundation for the American Dream, rebuilt.”**

## Messaging Strategy by Medium

### 30-Second TV Ad

*“Fifteen percent flat tax. File in five minutes. Small businesses pay almost nothing. Billionaires finally pay their share. Wall Street speculation crushed. Your wages up. Your retirement secure. Simple. Fair. American. [Candidate name] supports the American Prosperity Act.”*

### Social Media (Tweet/Post)

*“Current: 75,000-page tax code, billionaires pay 8%, small business pays 24%. APA: One-page tax code, billionaires pay 20%, small business pays 2%. Which sounds fair to you?”*

### Door-to-Door Canvassing

*“Hi, quick question: Did you need an accountant for your taxes last year? [Yes] What if I told you there’s a plan where you could file in 5 minutes on your phone, pay less, and billionaires would finally pay their share? [Tell me more…] Here’s how it works…”*

### Editorial/Op-Ed Opening

*“America’s tax code is 75,000 pages of special interest giveaways that punish work and reward speculation. The American Prosperity Act replaces it with simple math: 15% on income, 2.5% on Wall Street trades, and massive breaks for small businesses creating jobs. It’s revenue neutral, economically liberating, and long overdue.”*

### Debate Response (When Attacked)

*“My opponent says this helps the rich. Really? It taxes Wall Street speculation at 2.5% and kills the ‘buy, borrow, die’ loophole that lets billionaires pay zero. It’s the first tax plan in history that the ultra-wealthy can’t avoid. That’s not helping the rich—that’s finally making them pay.”*
